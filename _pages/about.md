I am currently a Senior Data Scientist within [Finastra](https://www.finastra.com)'s GenAI(X) Lab working on applications of natural language to financial services industry.

Prior to joining Finastra, I completed my Ph.D. in Mathematics from the [Courant Institute](https://cims.nyu.edu/dynamic/) under the supervision of [Benjamin Peherstorfer](https://cims.nyu.edu/~pehersto/).  My thesis was on the topic of multifidelity models for Bayesian inference.
