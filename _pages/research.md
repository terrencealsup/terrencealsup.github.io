My research is primarily focused on multi-fidelity methods for speeding up inference in uncertainty quantification (UQ) with two distinct flavors:

1. **Forward UQ**
2. **Inverse UQ**


## **Forward UQ**

### Multi-fidelity covariance estimation


## **Inverse UQ**

### Multilevel Stein Variational Gradient Descent

### Multi-fidelity Importance Sampling
